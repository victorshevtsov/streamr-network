# @streamr/dht (WIP)

An implementation of the Kademlia-based Streamr DHT used for the trackerless network.

## Generating Protobuf code

Auto-generated protobuf/gRPC code is compiled during the build process.
```bash
  npm run build
```

Alternatively
```bash
  npm run prebuild
  # Or
  ./proto.sh
```

## Running DHT simulations

Generate test data

```bash
npm run prepare-dht-simulation
```

Run simulation

```bash
npm run run-dht-simulation
```

In order to change number of nodes, or other simulation settings,

* Edit the chages to the file 'test/simulation/data/generatedhtids.ts'.
* Then generate new test data by running 'npm run prepare-dht-simulation'
* Edit the same changes to file 'src/simulation/DhtSimulation.ts'
* Run the simulation with new settings using 'npm run run-dht-simulation '
