## Community contributions
Please feel very welcome to submit content suggestions!

For ease of use, small changes can be suggested by editing the markdown file on GitHub. Every content page has an "Edit this page" link at the bottom- Simply edit the text contents and submit a pull request to have the change reviewed before it is implemented.

### Run it locally
Simply, `npm i` & `npm start`

## Streamr core devs
Deployments are automatically made after every commit to `main`, therefore editing markdown files directly on `main` will be reflected in production within a minute or two.
