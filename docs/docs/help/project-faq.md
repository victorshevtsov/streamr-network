# Project FAQ

### Who is using Streamr?
Streamr is being used to power data pipelines, blockchain oracles and progressive Web3 projects that value a fully decentralized stack.

To name a few; [DIMO](https://dimo.zone), [Swash](https://swashapp.io), & [Redstone](https://redstone.finance).

<!-- TODO: Add some more clearer use cases  -->
### Is the Network decentralized?
Yes. Anyone can run a node on the Network and anyone can create a stream on the Network without anyone's permission. The Network is governed by improvement proposals which are voted on by the holders of the DATA token.

### Does Streamr scale?
Yes. We've worked very hard to prove that the Network does indeed scale. You can read more about that in our technical [Network whitepaper](https://streamr.network/network-whitepaper) and our higher level blog post about the [performance and scalability of the Network](https://blog.streamr.network/streamr-network-performance-and-scalability-whitepaper/)

### What has the project delivered so far?
Streamr began in 2017, in that time the project has delivered:
- The decentralized real time data network
- The Streamr Client (JavaScript convenience library to interact with the Streamr Network)
- A data marketplace, offering pay to access data streams
- A Data Unions SDK
- The Hub; A stream creation and discovery UI. (Q1 2023)
- The incentive layer of the Network (estimated Q2 2023)

### What is the DATA token used for?
DATA is a quality of service and governance token for the Network. It is designed to be used primarily in the incentive layer of the Network to improve reliability, security and privacy in a decentralized setting.
